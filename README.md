# roomControl
Smart Room Control UI using NodeJS background tasks with AngularJS 

A fast and responsive UI that allows one to control smart room devices from a local webserver.

TLDR; for the quick and dirty setup, install your dependencies:

```
# (using BASH, not ZSH)
pip install nodeenv # should add to requirements at some point
nodeenv node; source node/bin/activate
cd src; npm start
```

## Development

# (using BASH, not ZSH)
source node/bin/activate
```

TBD

```
## Curent Architecture

### NodeJS Backend
The package.json file has the details.


### AngularJS Frontend
The ?? file loads depencencies from and ?? so it can load the <Lights/> object into the "tabs-1" container.

Using a touch gesture library (HammerJS?) tab navigation is achieved.
